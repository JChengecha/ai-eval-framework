## LinkedIn Post

🎯 Just built an AI Task Evaluation Framework for analyzing failure patterns in ML systems!

As AI agents become more prevalent in production (especially in finance), understanding *why* they fail is critical. I developed a statistical analysis framework that:

✅ Analyzes performance across multiple dimensions (task type, file format, domain, etc.)
✅ Performs chi-square significance testing to validate patterns
✅ Generates data-driven root cause hypotheses
✅ Creates stakeholder-ready dashboards and visualizations

The framework processes 1000+ evaluations and identifies high-risk segments, temporal trends, and interaction effects between failure dimensions.

**Built with:** Python, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

This type of systematic failure analysis is essential for improving:
- Task design and rubric clarity
- Model training and fine-tuning
- Quality assurance processes
- Production ML monitoring

Perfect for teams doing LLM evaluation, AI QA, or model benchmarking.

## Cover Letter Addition

In my recent work, I developed an AI Task Evaluation Framework that directly aligns with your team's needs for statistical failure analysis. This project demonstrates:

**Statistical Analysis:** I implemented chi-square testing, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing to identify significant patterns in AI agent failures across multiple dimensions—similar to the multi-dimensional analysis required in your role.

**Finance Domain Experience:** The framework was specifically designed for finance-sector applications, analyzing performance across banking, trading, and risk management domains.

**Data Visualization:** I created comprehensive dashboards and stakeholder-ready reports, translating complex statistical findings into actionable insights.

**Root Cause Analysis:** The system generates data-driven hypotheses about failure causes (task design vs. rubric clarity vs. model limitations), mimicking the analytical approach your team needs.

This project showcases my ability to combine statistical rigor with practical ML evaluation—exactly what's needed to analyze AI agent performance and recommend framework improvements.
